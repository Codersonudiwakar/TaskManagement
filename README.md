# TaskTracker-RestAPI
Task Tracker API with PostgreSQL Backend

# Instructions for Task Tracker RESTful API - Quick Start Guide
### Step 1: Set Up my Project
Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/).
Add the following dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, DevTool, PostgreSQL.
Configure database connection in application.properties.

### Step 2: Define Task Entity
Create a Task class with properties: id, title, description, and dueDate.
Annotate the class with @Entity and use appropriate annotations for properties.

### Step 3: Create Repository
Create a TaskRepository interface that extends JpaRepository<Task, String>.
This provides basic CRUD operations for the Task entity.
### Step 4: Implement Controller
Create a TaskController class.
Annotate it with @RestController and define the base request mapping (e.g., /api/tasks). 

### Step 5: Define API Endpoints
Implement methods for GET all tasks, GET task by ID, POST new task, PUT update task, and DELETE task.
Use appropriate annotations like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.
Inject TaskRepository into the controller to interact with the database.

### Step 6: Test This API
Run your Spring Boot application.
Use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints you've defined.

### Step 7: Error Handling and Validation
Implement proper error handling for scenarios like resource not found, bad requests, etc.
Use validation annotations (@Valid) on request bodies to ensure data integrity.

request and response formats, error handling, data validation and example usage.
And all the process working properly as you mention in Assignments.
we can Customize and enhance this project as needed for client requirements.

I am excited and Thankful to you for given me this opportunity.I have filled your all required please check this project and 
let me know and 
Thankyou once again
